This project is a full-fledged site for my friend-designer. It's my very own project and was written from scratch by myself.
It includes a lot of stuff that I can show off as a React developer:

1. Responsive Web design.
2. Form validation.
3. Async requests for 3rd party API.
4. Work with CSS animations.
5. Utilize a lot of hook advantages in the project.
6. Using Redux for State management inside applications.
7. Using react-router-DOM for routing.

Check please [working example](https://inikolas.github.io/rp-design/) if you were interested in.
